  <h2>Did you know?</h2><br>
    <p>The Mughal, Mogul or Moghul Empire, was an early modern empire in South Asia.[9] For some two centuries, the empire stretched from the outer fringes of the Indus basin in the west, northern Afghanistan in the northwest, and Kashmir in the north, to the highlands of present-day Assam and Bangladesh in the east, and the uplands of the Deccan plateau in south India.[10]

        The Mughal empire is conventionally said to have been founded in 1526 by Babur, a warrior chieftain from what is today Uzbekistan, who employed military aid in the form of matchlock guns and cast cannon from the Ottoman Empire,[11] and his superior strategy and cavalry to defeat the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodhi,[12][13] in the First Battle of Panipat,[14][15] and to sweep down the plains of Upper India, subduing Rajputs and Afghans.[16][17][18] The Mughal imperial structure, however, is sometimes dated to 1600, to the rule of Babur's grandson, Akbar,[19] This imperial structure lasted until 1720, until shortly after the death of the last major emperor, Aurangzeb,[20][21] during whose reign the empire also achieved its maximum geographical extent. Reduced subsequently, especially during the East India Company rule in India, to the region in and around Old Delhi, the empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
        
        Although the Mughal empire was created and sustained by military warfare,[22][23][24] it came to rule by establishing new administrative practices,[25][26] and incorporating diverse ruling elites, leading to more efficient, centralised, and standardised rule.[27] The base of the empire's collective wealth was agricultural taxes, instituted by the third Mughal emperor, Akbar.[28][29] These taxes, which amounted to well over half the output of a peasant cultivator,[30] were paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[27] and caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[31]
        
        The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion.[32] Burgeoning European presence in the Indian Ocean, and its increasing demand for Indian raw and finished products, created still greater wealth in the Mughal courts.[33] There was more conspicuous consumption among the Mughal elite,[34] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture, especially during the reign of Shah Jahan.[35] Among the Mughal UNESCO World Heritage Sites in South Asia are: Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Lahore Fort and the Taj Mahal, which is described as the "jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage."</p>

  <h2>Did you know?</h2><br>
    <p>Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth’s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.

        Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!
        
        Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth’s inner structure. They’ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists —  including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago — have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth’s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.
        
        Here’s a primer on Earth’s layers, starting with a journey to the center of the planet.

        The inner core
        This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It’s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth’s surface. Extremely dense, it’s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It’s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400° Celsius (9,800° Fahrenheit). That’s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth’s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.
        
        The outer core
        This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth’s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth’s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.
        
        The mantle
        At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth’s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.
        
        Explainer: How heat moves
        Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle’s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth’s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.
        
        Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare “super-deep” diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.
        
        The mantle’s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.

        The crust
        Earth’s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It’s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.
        
        Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly — at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it’s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called “slab pull.” In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It’s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth’s surface.

  <h2>Did you know?</h2><br>
  <p>
    An Indian politician is somebody who is elected from his/her constituency. Every politician has their constituency from where they are elected. They then actively delve into politics. Since independence, India has strived forward thanks to the laws implemented by politicians. 

    Indians can take pride in the fact that they are the largest democracy in the world. The PM or prime minister heads the country. He is the head of the government formed at the center. Likewise, the president is head of the central and the state government. 
    
    The Indian parliament consists of the upper and lower house. The upper house is known as the Rajya Sabha and the lower house is called the Lok Sabha. The upper house consists of members who represent the states of the country. 
    
    The lower house consists of members elected to represent the people of the country. The Supreme Court or SC is the protector of the constitution of India. Indian politics comprises three pillars that consist of the central leadership, state leadership, and the village or panchayat raj. 
    
    The panchayat ray is still prominent in several villages and most rural parts of the country. Thanks to the 73rd constitutional amendment, local governance is acceptable. India is a democratic country where the leaders are elected through elections held once in four years. 
    
    The party with the largest vote bank after the election can claim their victory. To vote in India, one must be an Indian citizen, and above 18 years of age. They need to obtain an election card. 
    
    Anybody can contest in the elections in India. The individual should be an Indian citizen and have completed 25 years of age. Additionally, there are a few more conditions to be met that most candidates become eligible for. 
    
    In India, there are no criteria for contesting elections. Hence, it is not surprising to note that many legislators have little to no education. One can use NOTA when they feel that their constituent candidate is not well-educated or is worthy of the position. 
    
    In this paragraph on Indian politics, one learns about the lack of educational qualifications for the politicians. In most of the developed and developing countries, the politicians are an educated lot.
    
    Education and corruption cannot go in hand. The opposition needs to be proactive and take a tough stance on the ruling of the government. The country's few significant parties include BJP, Indian National Congress, CPI, AAP, BSP, and the SP. 
    
    It is safe to say that the political scenario can be changed for the greater good of the country and society.
